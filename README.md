# Arduino-Project

The Gesture Vocalizer is an Arduino-based project designed to translate hand gestures into vocalized speech. By using a flex sensor attached to a glove, the system can detect specific hand movements and convert them into corresponding voice outputs. This project is particularly beneficial for individuals with speech impairments, allowing them to communicate more effectively using hand gestures.

Features
Gesture Detection: Captures hand movements using a flex sensor.
Vocal Output: Translates detected gestures into spoken words or phrases.
Customizable Gestures: Easily program new gestures and corresponding vocal outputs.
Portable and Wearable: Designed to be lightweight and comfortable for everyday use.

Basically, its a glove with flex sensors, that works as gesture vocalizer
